;;; Commentary:

;; This makes elscreen can manage buffer list for each screen.
;;
;; To use this, add the following line somewhere in your init file:
;;
;;      (require 'elscreen-separate-buffer-list)
;;      (elscreen-separate-buffer-list-mode)
;;
;; This apply to ido-mode or something that uses ido-make-buffer-list such as helm.
